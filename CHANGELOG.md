# Changelog

## 2026-10-07
- Created solution foundation: `GroceryPOS.sln`, `Directory.Build.props` (nullable, warnings-as-errors), `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `ROADMAP.md`.
- Added `GroceryPOS.Domain`: identity (User with lockout, Role, permission catalog, 4 system roles), catalog (Category, Product with EAN check-digit validation, VAT 0/5/8/10%, stock rules), partners (Supplier, Customer with loyalty points), audit log.
- Added `GroceryPOS.Application`: Result/Error pattern, repository/UoW/password-hasher/current-user/audit abstractions, VND formatter/parser (vi-VN).
- Added `AuthService`: login with lockout (5 failures → 15 min), change password with password policy, logout, all audited.
- Note: nuget.org was blocked in the build sandbox, so only package-free projects were added this run.
